# Student project template

This is a template for student projects. We use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to administrate our student projects and so you need to sign up for a [GitHub Account](http://github.com). You can use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template/blob/master/student_project.ipynb) to work on your project.

Please ensure that a brief description of your project is included in the [README.md](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template/blob/master/README.md), which provides a proper citation of your baseline article. Also, please set up the following badge that allows to easily access your project notebook.

To ensure full reproducibility of your project, please try to set up a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as your continuous integration service. An introductory tutorial for [conda](https://conda.io) and [Travis-CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) is provided [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template/blob/master/tutorial_conda_travis.ipynb). While not at all mandatory, setting up a proper continuous integration workflow is an extra credit that can improve the final grade.

## Structure

A typical student project has the following structure:

* presentation of baseline article with proper citation and brief summary

* using causal graphs to illustrate the authors' identification strategy

* replication of selected key results

* critical assessment of quality

* independent contribution, e.g. additional external evidence, robustness checks, visualization

There might be good reason to deviate from this structure. If so, please simply document your reasoning and go ahead. Please use the opportunity to review other student projects for some inspirations as well.

## Frequently asked questions and answers

* *Where can I look for publications that provide the data behind their research?* Some journals provide the data for their published articles as data supplements directly on their website. In addition, the [Replication Wiki](http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)  and the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu) compile a lot such information.

* *What are other useful resources for research data?* There is a tremendous amount of data available online. For example, MDRC provides a host of data files for public use [here](https://www.mdrc.org/available-public-use-files) from the evaluation of public policy initiatives.
